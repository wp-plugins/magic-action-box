= My action box doesn't seem to have any styles to it. What's wrong? =

Make sure that your uploads directory wp-content/uploads/ is writeable (it usually is).

= I just recently updated the plugin and the action box looks weird. =

Try clearing the plugin cache using the *Clear Cache* button found in WP Admin -> Magic Action Box Settings -> Main Settings

= The action box is showing up after some other social sharing icons placed by another plugin. But I want it to show up right after the blog post =

Try checking the *Reorder post content filter priorities* checkbox found in WP Admin -> Magic Action Box Settings -> Main Settings. Please understand that this may not solve the problem and may conflict with other plugins too. Just uncheck it if it does.
