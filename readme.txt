== Installation ==

2. Upload the magic-action-box folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory in your web site.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress administration page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin. What now? =

Check out the [Quick Start guide](http://www.magicactionbox.com/quick-start?pk_campaign=LITE&pk_kwd=faq_qs) to get started.

= My autoresponder is not on the list. Can I use it with the plugin? =

Yes you can. As long as your autoresponder lets you create html forms that you can copy and paste, then you are all good. Watch this [video tutorial](http://www.magicactionbox.com/how-use-magic-action-box-with-any-email-marketing-service/?pk_campaign=LITE&pk_kwd=faq) to learn more.

= Shortcode and Template Tag (available in Pro) =

You may use the *[magicactionbox id="ACTION BOX ID"]* shortcode in your blog posts or the `mab_get_actionbox( ACTION_BOX_ID )` template tag in your theme template.

= Can I place an action box on my website's sidebar? =

Yes. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to the Widgets page and lookg for the Magic Action Box Widget.

= My action box doesn't seem to have any styles to it. What's wrong? =

Make sure that your uploads directory wp-content/uploads/ is writeable (it usually is). Then save your action box or custom style again to allow the plugin to generate the required css code.

= My action box has a lot of empty spaces and line breaks in it. = 

Go to Magic Action Box Settings -> Main Settings and check the Minify HTML Output checkbox.

= My action box styles are gone. What did your update do? =

If you just upgrade from any version below 2.8, then this is expected due to the big improvements in the code. We're sorry for the scare but don't worry, just follow the steps [in this guide](http://www.magicactionbox.com/fixing-action-box-styles-v2-8-upgrade/?pk_campaign=LITE&pk_kwd=faq) and you should get back your converting users in no time.

= I just recently updated the plugin and the action box looks weird. =

Try clearing the plugin cache using the *Clear Cache* button found in WP Admin -> Magic Action Box Settings -> Main Settings

= The action box is showing up after some other social sharing icons placed by another plugin. But I want it to show up right after the blog post =

Try checking the *Reorder post content filter priorities* checkbox found in WP Admin -> Magic Action Box Settings -> Main Settings. Please understand that this may not solve the problem and may conflict with other plugins too. Just uncheck it if it does.
